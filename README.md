# shell-tube-he
A simple shell and tube heat exchanger design based on Kern's method. The brief situation consists on heat up ketone at specific flow rate and temperature using therminol60 at 100Â°C. From some parameters, we had to find out:
- `Heat transfet coefficient`: get h value of tube and shell side. Nusselt number was provided by Dittus-Boelter equation
- `Required heat transfer area`: Consider Q = 50kW
  
Some data like shell diameter and num of tubes were predicted to get these values above, after that all of these were iterated to reach out better characteristics for this process.

Pressure drop in tube side also can be measured.
